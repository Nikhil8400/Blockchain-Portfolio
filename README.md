# 🚀 Nikhil Pandey — Smart Contract Researcher & Auditor

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a dedicated **Smart Contract Researcher & Auditor**, passionate about **blockchain security** and **decentralized systems**. I specialize in auditing, vulnerability research, and building secure smart contracts with a focus on reliability and protocol correctness.

I’ve worked extensively with **EVM-compatible chains**, **OpenZeppelin libraries**, and key standards like **ERC20, ERC721, EIP-712**, as well as **proxy patterns**, **Chainlink VRF**, and **IPFS** integrations.
