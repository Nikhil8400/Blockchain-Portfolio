# 🚀 Nikhil Pandey — Smart Contract Developer & Security Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a dedicated **Smart Contract Researcher & Auditor**, passionate about **blockchain security** and **decentralized systems**. I specialize in auditing, vulnerability research, and building secure smart contracts with a focus on reliability and protocol correctness.

I’ve worked extensively with EVM-compatible chains, OpenZeppelin libraries, and key standards like ERC20, ERC721, and EIP-712, as well as proxy patterns, Chainlink VRF, and IPFS integrations. I’ve audited a wide range of protocols including DeFi primitives such as lending/borrowing platforms, CDPs, DEXes, stablecoins, and cross-chain bridges. Additionally, I’ve analyzed protocols involving liquid staking, veTokenomics, NFT infrastructure, governance mechanisms, and yield optimization strategies.
